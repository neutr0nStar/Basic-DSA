# Graph notes

**Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges**

Mathematically: **G = (V, E)**

### Props

- Tree is a type of graph.
- Nodes are also called vertices.
- No. of vertices: **|V|**
- No. of edges: **|E|**
- Min no of edges: **0**
- Max no of edges:
  - **n(n-1)**: if directed
  - **n(n-1)/2**: if undirected
- A graph with no edges is also valid.
- Directed (aka digraph) or undirected
- Weighted or unweighted
- **Path**: A sequence of vertices where each adjacent pair is connected by an edge.
- **Closed Path(Cycle)**: Starts and ends at same vertex, length > 0.
- **Strongly connected graph**: There exists a path from any vertex to any other vertex. (undirected: _connected_, directed: _strongly connected_)
- Self loop is a edge having only one vertex.
- Parallel paths are 2 edges between 2 nodes.

## Graph representation

### Edge list

We will store vertices and edges in two different lists.

| Vertices |
| -------- |
| A        |
| B        |
| C        |
| ...      |

| Edge list |
| --------- |
| A, B, 12  |
| B, C, 11  |
| C, A, 20  |

```c
    struce Edge{
        // we can use index of the vertex in vertex list,
        // or pointer to vertex in vertex list also
        string start_vertex;
        string end_vertex;
        int weight;
    }
```

Space complexity of this is ok O(v), but time complexity is O(v^2) which is bad. (v = |V|).

Useful for sparse graph. (less edges)

### Adjacency Matrix

Vertex list same as above

**Adjacency matrix**

|       | 0   | 1   | 2   |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- |
| **0** | 0   | 1   | 1   |
| **1** | 1   | 0   | 1   |
| **2** | 1   | 1   | 0   |

Here, 0,1,2.. represent indexes in vertex list.
To find index for a vertice quickly, we can use a hash table.

Here, 0 and 1 in the matrix represent false and true respectively.
For a weighted graph, we can store the weight instead of 0 and one, for no adjacency, we will store _+/-inf_

Row index: _start point_, Column index: _end point_

Symmetric about leading diagonal.

We have improved time compexity here O(v), but space complexity has increased O(v^2).

Useful for dense graph (more edges).

### Adjacencey List:

Vertex list remains same.

Adjacencey matrix takes up a lot of space, and a lot of it is wasted in storing 0 (no edge).

Instead, we can store adjacent vertices (or their indices) in an array or list or BST.

**Array**:
` int *A[ |V| ]`
with the help of pointers, we can dynamically assign sizes using `A[0] = new int[3]`.

Useful for sparse graph (better than adj mat).
