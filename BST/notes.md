### Definitions

* #### Node
    An element of tree.
* #### Root Node
    Top most element of tree.
* #### Leaf Node
    Node with no child(ren).
* #### Sibling Nodes
    Nodes having same parents.
* #### Parent node
    Node immediately before given node.
* #### Child(ren) node
    Immideate descendant(s) of given node.
* #### Depth of a node
    Number of edges in path from root to that node.
* #### Height of a node
    Longest path from the node to a leaf node.
* #### Traversal
    Visiting each node exactly once.
* #### Binary tree
    Tree having nodes having at most 2 childre.
* #### Full binary tree
    A binary tree in which all nodes have either 2 or 0 children.
* #### Complete binary tree
    A Binary Tree is a Complete Binary Tree if all the levels are completely filled except possibly the last level and the last level has all keys as left as possible
* #### Perfect binary tree
    A binary tree such that all interior nodes have 2 children (leaves), and all leaves are at same level.
* #### Binary search tree
    Binary tree that has following properties:
    * The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
    * The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
    * The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.
