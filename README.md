## Data structures
* Linked List
  * Singly linked list
  * Doubly linked list
  * Circular linked list
* Stack
  * Array implementation
  * Linked list implementation
* Queue
  * Circular array implementation
  * Linked list implementation
* Binary Search Tree
* Graph

## Algorithms
* Searching algorithms
  * Linear search
  * Binary search
* Sorting algorithms
  * Bubble sort
  * Insertion sort
  * Merge sort
  * Quick sort
  * Selection Sort
* Linked list algorithms
  * Basic operations:
     * Insert at beginning, end and at any position
     * Delete element at beginning, end and at any position
  * Print elements iteratively and recursively
  * Reverse list iteratively and recursively
  * Swap 2 elements
  * Overload array access operator (eg: **list[2]**)
* Stack
  * Basic operations **push, pop, peek, isEmpty**
  * Reverse linked list using stack
  * Check for balanced parenthesis
  * Infix to postfix
  * Postfix evaluation
* Queue
  * Basic operations **enqueue, dequeue, peek, isEmpty**
* Binary search tree
  * Basic operations **insertions, deletion and searching**
  * Find minimum and maximum element
  * Depth first traversal (inorder, preorder, postorder)
  * Breadth first traversal
  * Check if given binary tree is binary search tree
* Graph
  * Insertion
  * Breadth first traversal
